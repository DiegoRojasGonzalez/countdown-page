# Countdown Page

This project is a simple webpage that displays a countdown timer to the 30th of the current month. The countdown timer shows the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the 30th. If the current month doesn't have 30 days or if it's already the 30th, the timer will handle these edge cases appropriately.

## Setup

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

Once you have the project set up, you can use it by simply opening the `index.html` file in your web browser. The countdown timer will automatically start counting down to the 30th of the current month.

## Files

This project contains the following files:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the countdown timer.
- `js/countdown.js`: This JavaScript file contains the logic for the countdown timer.
- `css/styles.css`: This CSS file contains the styles for the countdown timer.
- `README.md`: This file contains the documentation for the project.

## Dependencies

This project does not have any dependencies. It uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and does not require any additional libraries or frameworks.

## Notes

Please note that this countdown timer assumes that all months have 30 days. If the current month has less than 30 days, the timer will start counting down to the 30th of the next month. If it's already the 30th or later, the timer will start counting down to the 30th of the next month.
